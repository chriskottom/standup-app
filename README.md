# Standup

My Rails Fu has gotten a little rusty over the past year and a half when I've
been working mostly on Laravel and Vue projects, so I thought I'd run through
the copy of [Build a SaaS App in Ruby on Rails 5](https://buildasaasappinrails.com/)
that I bought a while back to get my Ruby legs back under me, hopefully learn a
few new tricks for designing SaaS apps, and have a chance to check out what's
new in the framework since the last time I wrote a new application (Rails 4.2).

A version of this application is deployed at
[https://standup-app.herokuapp.com/](https://standup-app.herokuapp.com/).

## Learnings

I'm against the use of the word "learnings" as a replacement for the perfectly
good "lessons", but it seems appropriate in this case as a title for the things
I am actually learning.
